========================= Combat Mode ===========================
=================================================================

"Combat Mode 1.0":
#define COMBAT_MODE

- Toggling ON Combat Mode will enable clash input/detection.
  A togglable mode that simulates the HEV Suit user sustaining health/armor damage.

- Features are based on the findings in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oPGjA5-4AM (1:40).


**************************   Health & Armor   ****************************

- Health (health) and Armor (armor) have seperate pools of health. Both range from 0 - 100.
  
- armor should negate how much health gets subtracted. The formula in game for Normal difficulty (apparently):
  Armor will generally absorb 80% of damage, up until the point of where you are depleted of it,
  at which point 100% of damage is commited to your Health. Hence, even if you have 100% Armor,
  your Health is still affected when you take damage.
  Essentially, whenever there is armor, health should take 20% of physical damage.
  
- The amount of health/armor taken away depends on the amount of (real life) force to the chest plate.
  Maximum of 50 per hit.

- To regenerate health and armor, hold AUX and POW respectively. I believe it takes 10s to recharge from 0 - 100.

- When armor is 0, play boophighdouble.wav, then armor_compromised.wav followed by hev_damage.wav.
  Or...I could just mash these together in Audacity.

- Similarly, when calling armor readout, if armor is 100, play power_level_is_100.wav.

*****************   Hit Detection - For Physical Damage   *****************

- Hit Detection is measured by some form of clash monitoring/threshold. Will need testing.
  Similar to fett263's Responsive Clash detection, where the higher the input recieved,
  the higher the damage sustained to health and armor which are accompanied by audible cues via certain wavs.
  
  if (real life) force is applied to the chest plate, Physical Damage is taken and will always play either of two "hit" wavs.
  Which one plays depends on the Thud recieved, measured by Responsive Clash.
  Should we call this Responsive Thud?
  
	if:
		Light Thud - play pl_pain2.wav.
		Followed by either minor_fracture.wav or minor_lacerations.wav.
		45% chance of either of these "medical\detected\physical" voicelines playing,
		as it would get it annoying after everytime.
		Cooldown of 15s before playing another "medical\detected\physical" voiceline.
	else:
		Heavy Thud - play pl_fallpain3.wav.
		Followed by either major_fracture.wav or major_lacerations.wav.
		45% chance of either of these "medical\detected\physical" voicelines playing,
		as it would get it annoying after everytime.
		Cooldown of 15s before playing another "medical\detected\physical" voiceline.


-------------------------------- Boops & Fuzz --------------------------------

- Depending on current health, either one of three boop wavs play.
  if playing a "medical\detected\physical" voiceline is True, beeps always play at the same time as a "hit" wav.
  (So before a voiceline plays).
  Just to reiterate, the boop sounds only play if a voiceline is called.
  
	if:
		health >= 50 - play booplow.wav
	elif:
		health < 50 - play boopmid.wav
	elif:
		health <= 30 - play boophigh.wav

- (Side note) - I edited these 3 boop wavs to demonstrate the concept, as I'm under the impression
				that the suit dynamically changes the pitch and tempo of the boops depending
				on the user's current health. More of this can be seen in my video:
				https://youtu.be/zAka_vIXxtw?si=ACw29pQapn8aEZTp
				
				***armor Readouts***
				- (UPDATE) did some testing in game, with regards to the x2 fuzz.wavs that play before an armor readout,
				the suit seems to just pick one of two before the percentage readout. One is normal pitch and the other
				is slightly high in pitch. It would be cool if the OS just picks one of these fuzz wavs to play before
				the armor readout.
				I've put these together, they are in "HEVcommon\misc" - fuzzdouble.wav and fuzzhighdouble.wav.
  

-------------------------------- Suit ADVISE --------------------------------

- Similar to the health values above, the suit will tell the user to "seek medical attention" or similar.
  Three wavs should play after the "medical\detected\physical" voicelines.
  Each of these have a cooldown of 120s (2 minutes).
  
	if:
		health <= 50 - play seek_medic.wav after "medical\detected\physical" voiceline.
	elif:
		health <= 30 - play health_critical.wav after "medical\detected\physical" voiceline.
	elif:
		health <= 6 - play near_death.wav after "medical\detected\physical" voiceline.
		

-------------------------------- Suit AID --------------------------------

- Upon receiving the first Heavy Thud, or any damage greater than 50, the suit will administer a morphine shot.
  This should be played after either major_fracture.wav or major_lacerations.wav.
  Afterwards there is a 5 minutes wait (300s) before the next morphine shot can be given.
	if:
		Heavy Thud - play morphine_shot_heavythud.wav.
		Play directly after major_fracture.wav and/or major_lacerations.wav.


*****************   Timed Alerts - For Energy Damage   *****************

Timed Alerts - 	(We can honestly change these names) There are several voiced alerts whenever the HEV Suit user
				comes into contact with hazardous elemental substances. I figured the best way of incopoorating these
				sounds is to give them a chance of playing automatically every 10 - 20mins.
				I suggest a chance rate of 60% - 75% for specifically only one of these occuring within every 10 - 20mins.
				Instead of a fixed damage number, it would make it interesting to apply a random number
				for damage recieved, so like either 1 - 40 damage if Radiation is called.
				Example:

Radiation = if > 600s and < 1200s:
				60% chance of - play radiation_detected_blipblipblip.wav
								Apply 1 - 40 damage to armor and then negate 20% to current health.
								Would be 1 - 40 damage to health with 0 armor.
	
				These should be followed up by any "Suit Advise" prompts, noted above, if Health has dropped below
				a certain number.
				Given this, I'd suggest that these Energy Damages should probably just apply a flat random damage,
				instead of damage over time (which I suggested in my vid 1:12) as we'll probably never really see
				it diminishing over time, UNLESS I redo the suit and install an OLED screen. Jk...

Heat 	  = if > 600s and < 1200s:
				60% chance of - play heat_damage_boophigh.wav
								Apply 20 - 40 damage to armor and then negate 20% to current health.
								Would be 20 - 40 damage to health with 0 armor.
				
The same logic should be applied to the other various Energy Damages:

- Shock
- Biohazard
- Chemical
- Blood Toxins (Maybe this one could randomly proc if energy damage has applied to health and I havn't healed in over 5 minutes.)
- Blood Loss (this one plays when you get shot...hmmmmm.)
- Internal Bleeding (this one was cut from the game, so not sure about this either.)
